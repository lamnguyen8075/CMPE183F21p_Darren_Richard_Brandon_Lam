PROJECT INDOTRUCTION
LegitHubâ€™s goal is to improve the confidence of buyers of commonly couterfeited items
Secondary marketplaces rely on trust and manual inspection to determine authenticity which is unreliable
The solution is to register each item manufactured onto the blockchain for proof of authenticity and track the life cycle of each item
